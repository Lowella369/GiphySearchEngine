# Giphy Search API

**Name: Lowella Fox**

**Description:** Giphy Search API is an application that will allow user to enter and submit a keyword and then makes a request to the Giphy API based on that keyword, receives and parses the response and displays images on the page from that response. This page is also responsive that it looks good and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please take note, the About and Contact nav bar is not working at this moment, I just put it there to comply with the requirements.

**Functionality:** 
1.	User will enter keyword to the input box
2.	Hit the search button
3.	GIFs will be displayed on the page

**Technologies Used:** HTML, JQuery, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap 4

**Future Improvement:**
1. Need to add html page and link for About and Contact page
